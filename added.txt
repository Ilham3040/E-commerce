If your solution solves a concrete programming problem—and especially if that problem (and its resolution) isn’t already on Stack Overflow—then yes, Stack Overflow is a great place to share it. In fact, the site explicitly encourages “self‑answered” Q&A: you post your question and immediately post the answer you discovered.

Here’s how to do it well:

Write a clear, focused question

Give it a descriptive title (e.g. “Why does my Spring Boot app fail to start when I upgrade to Java 23?”).

Include a minimal, reproducible example of what went wrong.

Tag it appropriately (java, spring-boot, java-23, etc.).

Post your answer right away

Click the “Answer your own question” checkbox when you ask.

Provide the step‑by‑step fix or explanation you used.

Include code snippets, error messages, and links-to-docs as needed.

Follow-up

Monitor comments for clarification requests and improve both Q and A.

Accept your own answer once the community up‑votes or after 48 hours.

When to choose another platform
Broad tutorials or opinion pieces → publish on a blog, Dev.to, or Medium.

Reusable code snippets → GitHub Gist or a public repo README.

Video or multi‑part guides → YouTube, a personal website, or a learning platform.

But for specific “I had this error → here’s exactly how I fixed it,” a self‑answered post on Stack Overflow is spot‑on.
